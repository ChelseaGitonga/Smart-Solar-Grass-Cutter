# Smart-Solar-Grass-Cutter

### Final year project:
### Project title: Fully autonomous solar grass cutter
### Specific objectives met:
 - Modelled a robot using Unified Robot Description Format (URDF) and housed the robot in a world built using Gazebo Building Editor Tool.
 - Implemented Graph Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (Graph SLAM) algorithm resulting in the generation of a binary occupancy grid map of the robot's world.
 - Implemented Adaptive Monte Carlo Localization (AMCL) algorithm resulting in the generation of the robot’s pose ( position and orientation) within the mapped environment.
 - Implemented Dijkstra’s classical path planning algorithm resulting in straight-line navigation within the robot's configuration space.
 - Implemented Bug 1 algorithm resulting in static obstacle avoidance while navigating through the robot's configuration space.
### Purpose:
This project serves as a demonstration of my proficiency in robotics and autonomous systems. Using the Unified Robot Description Format (URDF) and the Gazebo Building Editor Tool, I modeled a robot and created a simulated environment for it to operate in. I then implemented various algorithms such as Graph Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (Graph SLAM) and Adaptive Monte Carlo Localization (AMCL) to generate a binary occupancy grid map and determine the robot's pose within the environment. Additionally, I implemented Dijkstra's classical path planning algorithm and the Bug 1 algorithm for straight-line navigation and static obstacle avoidance within the robot's configuration space. This project showcases my understanding of robotics, sensor fusion, and autonomous systems, and my ability to apply these concepts to create a fully autonomous solar-powered grass cutter robot.
