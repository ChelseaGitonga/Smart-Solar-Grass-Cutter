# Smart-Solar-Grass-Cutter

### Final year project:
### Project title: Fully autonomous solar grass cutter
### Specific objectives met:
 - Modelled a robot using Unified Robot Description Format (URDF) and housed the robot in a world built using Gazebo Building Editor Tool.
 - Implemented Graph Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (Graph SLAM) algorithm resulting in the generation of a binary occupancy grid map of the robot's world.
 - Implemented Adaptive Monte Carlo Localization (AMCL) algorithm resulting in the generation of the robotâ€™s pose ( position and orientation) within the mapped     environment.
 - Implemented A* classical path planning algorithm resulting in straight-line navigation within the robot's configuration space.
 - Implemented Bug 1 algorithm resulting in static obstacle avoidance while navigating through the robot's configuration space.
